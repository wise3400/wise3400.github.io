				<p>
					The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max were officially announced alongside the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini and HomePod Mini via a virtual press event filmed and recorded at Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on October 13, 2020. Pre-orders began for the iPhone 12 Pro on October 16, 2020, and it was released on October 23, 2020, with pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Pro Max beginning on November 6, 2020, with a full release on November 13, 2020.[17] This marked the first time since the release of the iPhone XS and iPhone XR where a new iPhone was not released simultaneously on the same date as other announced models. Pricing starts at US$999 for the iPhone 12 Pro and US$1099 for the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

				<p>
					It is the first major redesign since the iPhone X, similar to that of iPad Pros since 2018 and the 4th-generation iPad Air. The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max feature a flat chassis, a design seen with the iPhone 4 through the iPhone 5S and the first generation iPhone SE. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.[18] The bezels are around 35% thinner than the iPhone 11 Pro and previous models. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened glass.[19] On the back is the same three-camera configuration found on the iPhone 11 Pro, but with larger apertures and an added LiDAR scanner.
				</p>
				<p>
					The iPhone 12 Pro is available in four colors: Silver, Graphite, Gold, and Pacific Blue. Pacific Blue is a new color replacing Midnight Green, while Graphite is a renaming of Space Grey.

						The iPhone 12 Pro uses Apple's six-core A14 Bionic processor, which contains a 16-core neural engine. It has three internal storage options: 128 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB. The iPhone 12 Pro has an IP68 water and dust-resistant rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to six meters (20 feet) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone.

					</p>

					<p>

						The iPhone 12 Pro, like the iPhone 12, is not supplied with EarPods or the power adapter included with prior iPhone models. Apple claims this will reduce carbon emissions and that most users already own these items.[21] Apple still supplies the USB-C to Lightning cable that was introduced with the iPhone 11 Pro. In addition to Lightning and Qi wireless charging, the phones introduce MagSafe wireless charging, a new magnet-based charging and accessory system that allow accessories such as chargers and cases to snap onto the back of the phones. MagSafe wireless charging supports up to 15 watts, is fast-charge capable, and is a reimagining of the MagSafe brand that was introduced in 2006 with the original MacBook Pro. The MagSafe Charger can be purchased separately, along with a variety of cases and other accessories.

					</p>

					<p>
						The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max support 5G cellular communications. This allows upload speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s and download speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s. However, only models sold in the U.S. support the fastest mmWave technology; those sold elsewhere in the world, including Canada, support only sub-6GHz frequency bands. A new feature called Smart Data Mode enables 5G only when necessary to preserve battery life and data usage

							The iPhone 12 Pro features a 6.1-inch display and the larger iPhone 12 Pro Max variant features a 6.7-inch display. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with thinner bezels than previous generation iPhones. The iPhone 12 Pro Max features the largest display on any iPhone to date.[22] The phones also introduce a new glass-ceramic covering, named 'Ceramic Shield', which was co-developed with Corning Inc. Apple claims the Ceramic Shield has "4 times better drop performance" and that it is "tougher than any smartphone glass".

							The iPhone 12 Pro is supplied with a 10.78 Wh (2,815 mAh) battery, a slight decrease from the 11.67 Wh (3,046 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 11 Pro, and is identical to the battery found in the standard iPhone 12. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a 14.13 Wh (3,687 mAh) battery. The battery is not user-replaceable.

							Both the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are supplied with the Apple A14 Bionic, the first ARM-based smartphone system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on the 5 nm process node.[26] However, unlike previous years, the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are not the first Apple devices to receive the newest A-series processor, with the fourth-generation iPad Air being the first device from Apple to contain the A14 Bionic chip.[26] The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max also contain the Apple M14 motion coprocessor. The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max use Qualcomm's X55 5G modem.

							The iPhone 12 Pro features four cameras: one front-facing camera and three back-facing cameras, including a telephoto, wide, and ultra-wide camera. The iPhone 12 Pro also features a LiDAR scanner for AR and computer-aided photo enhancement services. The iPhone 12 Pro also adds Night Mode for video recording on all four cameras. Night Mode video supports up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second camera recording.[27] Unlike the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max where the only difference was the screen size and battery size, the iPhone 12 Pro Max adds sensor-shift image stabilization to the camera system, and replaces the f/2.0 aperture telephoto camera lens with a f/2.2 aperture lens. This allows for a maximum optical zoom range of 5x between the three back-facing cameras over the 4x range of the iPhone 12 Pro.[citation needed] The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are the first smartphones capable of shooting in 10-bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision 4K video at up to 60 frames per second.

							The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max feature iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.[30] The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.[31] Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).[31]
				</p>
				<p>
							The iPhone 12 Pro was first supplied with iOS 14.1. The devices come with the stock iOS apps, such as Safari, Weather, and Messages, and they also include Siri, the personal assistant included in iOS since iOS 5 with the release of the iPhone 4S.

				<p>
					The iPhone 12 Pro received positive reviews. The Verge called it a "beautiful, powerful, and incredibly capable device", praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone 5, the speed of the A14 Bionic processor, and its 5G capabilities[a], but noted the decrease in battery life compared to the iPhone 11 Pro and the low number of upgrades compared to the iPhone 12.[32] Engadget also gave the iPhone 12 Pro a positive review, praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessory system as well as the improved camera system, but noted the lack of upgrade motivation if users had already purchased a new iPhone in 2019.[33]

				</p>
				<p>
					Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device, which is incompatible with face masks. The iPhone SE (2nd generation) is the only phone that Apple currently produces that supports Touch ID, an alternative option that is compatible with face masks. All models can still use a passcode to log in.

				<p>
						Within two weeks after its public release, a thread was started at Apple Communities describing a problem with iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro OLED panel black pixels not shutting off completely in black scenes, resulting in what was described as "ugly glowing".[37] A considerable number of users have since posted replies reporting the same problem, photos and videos have been shared online demonstrating the issue. As of January 2021 Apple has not yet made an official statement, although a YouTube user claims that Apple Support reached back to them and told that "they are working on this problem".[38]

				<h3 id ="Removalofthepoweradapter&EarPods">Removal of the power adapter & EarPods</h3>
				<p>
						Apple, through an environmental initiative, has removed the EarPods (except in France) and power adapter (except in São Paulo[39]) from all new iPhone boxes, including the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. It is claimed that removing these items will reduce e-waste and permit a smaller iPhone box, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint. Apple now includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices. Users can still use their existing USB-A power adapters and cables, but must purchase a USB-C power adapter sold separately to enable Qi fast charging.[40]

				<h2 id = "Enviromentaldata">Enviromental data</h2>
				<h3 id = "Carbonfootprint">Carbon footprint</h3>
				<p>
						The iPhone 12 Pro has a carbon footprint of 82 kg (181 lb) carbon emissions, which is 6 kilograms (13 lb) more than the preceding iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a carbon footprint of 86 kg (190 lb) carbon emissions, a 6 kilograms (13 lb) increase compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max. 86% and 82% of all emissions released by producing the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max respectively are caused by device production and primary resource use with the remaining emissions released by means of first use, transportation, and end-of-life processing.
				</p>

				<h3 id = "Repairability">Repairability</h3>
				<p>
						Several weeks after its release, it was discovered by iFixit and Australian tech YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys that a number of key components such as the cameras malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit.[45] Internal Apple documents also mention that, beginning with the iPhone 12 and subsequent models, authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes. While Apple has yet to comment on the issue, the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about right to repair and planned obsolescence.
