					<b>My name is Wilson and I am currently a freshman at the University of Colorado Boulder and I am a first-generation student to attend college as well!  I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science Degree in Creative Technology and Design. I was born in New York and I moved here in Longmont, Colorado in 2008. I've been living in Longmont for at least 12 years now. I enjoy website building, coding, playing catch with dogs, hanging out with friends, and driving! </b>
